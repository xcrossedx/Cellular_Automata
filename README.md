# Cellular_Automata
This is a simple cellular automata framework currently set for Conway's "Game of Life".  
This was made using my Command-Line Interface Game Engine or CLIGE 2 library.

# Controls:  
Enter - switch to drawing mode  
Spacebar - start and stop simulation / place or remove cells in drawing mode  
WASD / Arrow Keys - move the viewport around the grid / move the cursor in drawing mode
